Hello this is a gameof Hangman,

the rules are simple, give a input(word/letter) to the code, if your letter is in the word, the code will show you, if you found all letter you win, if you give in input the correct word you win too.

to use the code, your version have to be in 1.21.0 or modif the file "go.mod"

To lauch the code use:

go run main/main.go {[DICTIONNARY/word.txt]/[DICTIONNARY/word2.txt]/[DICTIONNARY/word3.txt]} {[ASCII/shadow.txt]/[ASCII/standart.txt]/[ASCII/thinkertoy.txt]}

when there are []/[]/[], choose one of it, so exemple :

go run main/main.go DICTIONNARY/word.txt ASCII/shadow.txt

When your want to save, write :

Stop/stop in the input field, choose a name for your save and goodbye.

Good Luck Have Fun.
